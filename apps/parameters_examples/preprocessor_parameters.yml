# Some auxiliary data including units, magnitudes,
# sampling rate, number of acquired waveforms etc.
# will be saved into the 'aux/' directory. The
# measurements metadata and the interface to the
# rest of the data (bulk and auxiliary) will be
# saved into the 'load/' directory.

# the NumpyDataPreprocessor class (which can handle the numpy
# binary packing of the Daphne data).
