### General parameters
# The directory where the 'load/' and 'summary/'
# directories are located. The input data, as
# generated by the preprocessor, is expected to
# be in the 'load/' directory, and the output
# of the analyzer is saved in the 'summary/'
# directory.
workspace_dir: ''

# Every file in the load-directory whose name
# starts with one of the strings in this list
# is elegible for analysis, eventually depending
# on the analyzable_marks list
strips_to_analyze:
  - '450'
  - '225'
  - '1088'

# A file in the load-directory must contain
# in its name at least one of the strings in
# this list to be considered for analysis
analyzable_marks:
  - ''

# Whether to print functioning related messages
verbose: true

# Whether to generate a PDF report
generate_report: true

# Whether to flip the waveforms about the baseline
flip_about_baseline: false

### Parameters for the rebinning process
# Regarding the waveform signals: this is the
# number of adjacent points to be merged into
# a single point
merged_points: 8

### Physical parameters
# Area of the sensitive surface of the measured
# SiPMs. It is required because the DCR is normally
# expressed as a DCR superficial density, i.e. in
# in mHz per mm2.
sipm_sensitive_surface_area_in_mm2: 36.

### Parameters for the configuration of the peak detection algorithm
# It must belong to the interval [0.0, 1.0]. For
# each waveform, this value represents the fraction
# of the signal which is used to compute the
# baseline. P.e. 0.2 means that, for each waveform,
# only its first 20% (in time) of the signal is used
# to compute the baseline.
signal_fraction_for_median_cutoff: 0.2

# Required minimal height of the peaks, measured
# from the baseline of each waveform. Setting a cut
# in this magnitude has a twofold effect:
# - it helps to avoid detecting peaks in the
#   noise-induced triggers, and in the spurious
#   bipolar signals that sneaked into the correctly
#   triggered waveforms.
# - it makes the algorithm overlook some actual
#   peaks, particularly those which happen in the
#   undershooted tail of high-N-PE pulses.
# Both contributions cannot be completely separated
# (at least using only a height cut). A compromise
# must be found so that the proportion of detected
# noises makes up for the overlooked actual peaks.
# In any case, this parameter must not be set to a
# value which is bigger than half of the single-PE
# amplitude.
minimal_height_wrt_baseline_in_AU: 0.011 # 0.011 is given in volts
            
# The amplitude of 1-PE in massibo is normally 22 mV.
# Implicitly assuming the units of the analyzed data.
# Going for a bigger minimal prominence rules out
# after-pulses, which are not as prominent as the
# main pulses, because they are 'mounted' on top of
# a vanishing tail of the main pulse.
minimum_peaks_prominence: 0.006

# N.B.: The parameter above was rised from 0.005 to 0.006
# when analyzing the data for meas 4 of set 4, because
# it was counting as actual peaks just sinusoidal noises.
# N.B.2: The parameter above was set to 0.01 in the
# analysis which overlooked the afterpulses.

# Required minimal width of the peaks. Setting a cut
# in this magnitude helps to avoid detecting peaks
# in the noise-induced triggers. It is not a big
# deal anyway because we are going to discard those
# with the offline filter below, but just in case
# some of these fast frames make it to the filtered
# set, they won't contribute to the figures of merit
# (DCR, XTP and APP) since there will be no detected
# peaks within those.
minimum_peak_width_in_s: 0.02e-5

# N.B.: The parameter above was set to 0.04e-5 in the
# analysis which overlooked the afterpulses.

# This parameter is used for peak_width calculation. The
# height at which the peak width is computed is
# (h_peak-(P*rel_heigth)) where 
#   - h_peak is the value of the signal at the peak, and
#   - P is the prominence of the peak.
# Thus, setting rel_height_for_peak_width to 0.75 means
# that the width of the peak is computed at a height of
# one fourth of the peak's prominence.
rel_height_for_peak_width: 0.75

### Parameters for the configuration of the analysis (0.5pe-level computation) algorithm
# The following parameters are given to the
# DarkNoiseMeas.compute_amplitude_levels() method.
# Refer to its documentation for more information.
starting_fraction: 0.1
step_fraction: 0.01
minimal_prominence_wrt_max: 0.04
gaussian_fit_std_no: 3.0
# The following parameter has to do with how the
# NotEnoughFitSamples exception is handled when
# attempting the gaussian fits to the first two
# peaks of the amplitudes histogram.
max_gaussian_fit_std_no: 4.0
# The following parameter should be big enough to
# enable two gaussian fits with 3 free parameters
# each of the amplitudes histogram. Keeping it to
# 175 or above should be enough.
amplitudes_histogram_bins_no: 175
timedelay_cut: 1.e-4

### Parameters for integral filter
# Cut for the integral of each waveform. I.e.
# every waveform whose integral is less than this
# value (in a certain integration window) is
# considered to be a fake (noise-induced) trigger
# and is discarded.
minimum_integral: 0.4e-8

# The following four parameters have to do with
# the integration window for the integral filter.
# Either specify the two first variables, which
# are used in an 'smart' method to infer the integration
# window (this method is prone to errors), or specify
# 'window_start_s' and 'integral_window_width_s',
# which is a 'fixed' method but but has worked OK so
# far
tolerance_for_beginning_of_rise: 0.4       # Currently not used
delta_t_from_beginning_of_rise: 0.08e-5    # Currently not used
window_start_s: 0.0
integral_window_width_s: 0.45e-5

### Quality-control parameters
# If after applying the filter, the number of waveforms
# for a certain SiPM is less than this value, the
# reliability parameter for such SiPM is set to 0.
minimum_number_of_well_formed_waveforms: 100

# If everything went OK until the bursts purge, but
# after doing it, the number of waveforms for a certain
# SiPM is less than this value, then the magnitudes of
# interest (DCR, XTP and APP) are not computed for the
# burstless set of such SiPM, and the reliability
# parameter for such SiPM is set to 2.
minimum_number_of_non_burst_waveforms: 100

### Parameters for bursts-purge
# The default values for these parameters 
# are given in M. García et al paper.
min_consecutive_peaks_for_burst: 5
max_timedelay_for_consecutive_peak_in_s: 0.1   # 100 ms

### Parameters for filter-results report
# Number of waveforms per persistency plot
wvfs_per_step: 200

# Line width for the persistency plots

### Parameters for DCR, XTP and APP distributions report
# Number of bins in the resulting
# DCR, XTP and APP distributions
resulting_distributions_nbins: 40

# Linewidth for the vertical lines
# which mark the thresholds in the
# resulting DCR, XTP and APP distributions
vertical_thresholds_linewidth: 2.

### Parameters for PDF report
# The name of the PDF report file. It is saved in
# the summary directory.
report_output_filename: 'darknoise_report.pdf'

# The following parameters give font sizes. They
# are adjusted to the A4 format, and they must not
# be changed.
title_font_size: 24
subtitle_font_size: 20
text_font_size: 14

# During the PDF report generation, sub-PDF files
# are generated, whose number of pages is limited
# by this parameter. This is done to avoid memory
# issues. The final PDF report is the concatenation
# of all these sub-PDF files.
max_pages_per_pdf_chunk: 20

### Parameters for the output JSON files
# It controls the indentation with which the json
# summary-file is generated. It is eventually
# passed to the 'indent' parameter of json.dump.
indent: 4

# Whether to overwrite the output JSON file if it
# already exists
json_overwrite: true

### Parameters for the output dataframe
# The folder where the output dataframe is saved
# is the same as the one where the PDF report is saved
output_dataframe_filename: 'darknoise_output_dataframe'
