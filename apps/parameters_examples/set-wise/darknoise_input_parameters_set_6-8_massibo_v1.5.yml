### General parameters
# The directory where the 'load/' and 'summary/'
# directories are located. The input data, as
# generated by the preprocessor, is expected to
# be in the 'load/' directory, and the output
# of the analyzer is saved in the 'summary/'
# directory.
workspace_dir: 'ci_workspace/'

# If this parameter is not null, then it must
# be set to an integer which identifies the
# measurements set to be analyzed. I.e. the
# strip IDs to be analyzed will be taken from
# a list of strip IDs which is tabulated elsewhere
# and which is referred to the specified set
# number. If this parameter is null, then the
# strips_to_analyze list below is used to
# determine which strips are to be analyzed.
set_to_analyze: 6 # 6, 7, ...

# This parameter only makes a difference if
# the set_to_analyze parameter is null. In
# that case, every file in the load-directory
# whose name starts with one of the strings in
# this list is elegible for analysis, eventually
# depending on the analyzable_marks list.
strips_to_analyze: null

# A file in the load-directory must contain
# in its name at least one of the strings in
# this list to be considered for analysis
analyzable_marks:
  - 'darknoise'

# Whether to print functioning related messages
verbose: true

# Whether to generate a PDF report
generate_report: true

# Whether to flip the waveforms about the baseline
flip_about_baseline: true

### Parameters for the rebinning process
# Regarding the waveform signals: this is the
# number of adjacent points to be merged into
# a single point
merged_points: 2 # This value has not been fine-tuned yet

### Physical parameters
# Area of the sensitive surface of the measured
# SiPMs. It is required because the DCR is normally
# expressed as a DCR superficial density, i.e. in
# in mHz per mm2.
sipm_sensitive_surface_area_in_mm2: 36.

### Parameters for the configuration of the peak detection algorithm
# It must belong to the interval [0.0, 1.0]. For
# each waveform, this value represents the fraction
# of the signal which is used to compute the
# baseline. P.e. 0.2 means that, for each waveform,
# only its first 20% (in time) of the signal is used
# to compute the baseline.
signal_fraction_for_median_cutoff: 0.2

# Required minimal height of the peaks, measured
# from the baseline of each waveform. Setting a cut
# in this magnitude has a twofold effect:
# 1)  it helps to avoid detecting peaks in the
#     noisy baseline (which is typically contained
#     below half of the 1-PE amplitude, i.e. below
#     ~6 ADUs)
# 2)  it makes the algorithm overlook some actual
#     peaks, particularly those which happen in the
#     undershooted tail of high-N-PE pulses.
# Both contributions cannot be completely separated
# (at least using only a height cut). A compromise
# must be found so that the proportion of detected
# noises makes up for the overlooked actual peaks.
# In any case, this parameter must not be set to a
# value which is bigger than half of the single-PE
# amplitude.
minimal_height_wrt_baseline_in_AU: 6 # 6 is given in ADUs
            
# The amplitude of 1-PE in massibo (read with Daphne)
# is normally ~13 ADUs. We are implicitly assuming
# the units of the analyzed data. Setting a cut
# in this magnitude has a twofold effect:
# 1)  it helps to avoid detecting peaks in the
#     noisy baseline which somehow made it above
#     the minimal_height_wrt_baseline_in_AU
#     height cut
# 2)  it can also rule out after-pulses which are
#     not as prominent as the main pulses, because
#     they are 'mounted' on top of a vanishing
#     tail of the main pulse.
# Both contributions cannot be completely separated
# (at least using only a prominence+height cut).
# A compromise must be found so that the proportion
# of detected noises makes up for the overlooked
# actual after-pulses.
minimum_peaks_prominence: 5 # This number was fine-tuned using the data for the boards 7281 and 7291

# Required minimal width of the peaks. Setting a cut
# in this magnitude helps to avoid detecting peaks
# in the noise-induced triggers. It is not a big
# deal anyway because we are going to discard those
# with the offline filter below, but just in case
# some of these fast frames make it to the filtered
# set, they won't contribute to the figures of merit
# (DCR, XTP and APP) since there will be no detected
# peaks within those.
minimum_peak_width_in_s: 0.01e-5 # This value has not been fine-tuned yet

# N.B.: The parameter above was set to 0.04e-5 in the
# analysis which overlooked the afterpulses for the
# tektronix data.

# This parameter is used for peak_width calculation. The
# height at which the peak width is computed is
# (h_peak-(P*rel_heigth)) where 
#   - h_peak is the value of the signal at the peak, and
#   - P is the prominence of the peak.
# Thus, setting rel_height_for_peak_width to 0.75 means
# that the width of the peak is computed at a height of
# one fourth of the peak's prominence.
rel_height_for_peak_width: 0.75 

### Parameters for the configuration of the analysis (0.5pe-level computation) algorithm
# The following parameters are given to the
# DarkNoiseMeas.compute_amplitude_levels() method.
# Refer to its documentation for more information.

# The bins number used for the amplitudes histogram,
# which is used to find the 1.5-PE level, is
# first set to the value of
# maximum_first_amplitudes_histogram_bins_no.
# Then it is reduced by the
# amplitudes_histogram_bins_no_step parameter
# until a successful gaussian fit is achieved.
# Note that this scan should find a case where
# the bins number is big enough to allow
# the gaussian fit to be performed (i.e. to 
# have enough samples in the histogram to do
# a 3-parameters gaussian fit), but small enough
# to avoid fluctuations which could be
# misinterpreted as peaks. Note that these
# parameters should be set jointly with the
# amplitude_cut_for_gaussian_fit parameter below.
maximum_first_amplitudes_histogram_bins_no: 45
minimum_amplitudes_histogram_bins_no: 35
amplitudes_histogram_bins_no_step: 2

# and highest) to discard from the amplitudes
# histogram before performing the gaussian
# fits to find the 1.5-PE level.
fraction_of_extremal_samples_to_discard: 0.005
# Only the spotted peaks whose time-delay value
# is equal or bigger than this threshold, will
# contribute to the amplitudes histogram which
# is fitted to find the 1.5-PE level.
timedelay_cut_for_gaussian_fit: 1.e-4
# Only the spotted peaks whose amplitude value
# is equal or smaller than this threshold, will
# contribute to the amplitudes histogram which
# is fitted to find the 1.5-PE level.
amplitude_cut_for_gaussian_fit: 60.

### Parameters for integral filter
# Cut for the integral of each waveform. I.e.
# every waveform whose integral is less than this
# value (in a certain integration window) is
# considered to be a fake (noise-induced) trigger
# and is discarded.
minimum_integral: 1.6e-6 # This number was fine-tuned using the data for the boards 7281 and 7291

# The following four parameters have to do with
# the integration window for the integral filter.
# Either specify the two first variables, which
# are used in an 'smart' method to infer the integration
# window (this method is prone to errors), or specify
# 'window_start_s' and 'integral_window_width_s',
# which is a 'fixed' method but but has worked OK so
# far
tolerance_for_beginning_of_rise: 0.4       # Currently not used
delta_t_from_beginning_of_rise: 0.08e-5    # Currently not used
window_start_s: 0.125e-5
integral_window_width_s: 0.06e-5

# The following parameter is used to filter out
# the waveforms whose signal deviates from its
# baseline, negatively or positively, by more
# than this value. If it is set to null, then
# no filtering is applied.
maximum_allowed_pretrigger_oscillation_in_AU: 5.0

### Quality-control parameters
# If after applying the filter, the number of waveforms
# for a certain SiPM is less than this value, the
# reliability parameter for such SiPM is set to 0.
minimum_number_of_well_formed_waveforms: 100

# If everything went OK until the bursts purge, but
# after doing it, the number of waveforms for a certain
# SiPM is less than this value, then the magnitudes of
# interest (DCR, XTP and APP) are not computed for the
# burstless set of such SiPM, and the reliability
# parameter for such SiPM is set to 2.
minimum_number_of_non_burst_waveforms: 100

### Parameters for bursts-purge
# The default values for these parameters 
# are given in M. García et al paper.

# issues. The final PDF report is the concatenation
# of all these sub-PDF files.

### Parameters for the output JSON files
# It controls the indentation with which the json
# summary-file is generated. It is eventually
# passed to the 'indent' parameter of json.dump.

### Parameters for the output dataframe
# The folder where the output dataframe is saved
# is the same as the one where the PDF report is saved
output_dataframe_filename: 'darknoise_output_dataframe'
